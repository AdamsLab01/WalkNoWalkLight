# WalkNoWalkLight
 Walk/Don't Walk Traffic Light

 Walk/Don't Walk traffic light controller for Arduino/ATtiny85 multiple modes

This code is written for an ATtiny85 to control a walk/don't walk traffic light. I used SSRs conncted to the light/ATtiny to control the lights in various modes.

~ Normal - switch between walk/don't walk

~ Don't walk flash

~ Walk flash 

~ Don't walk solid

~ Walk and don't walk solid

~ Random/glitch
